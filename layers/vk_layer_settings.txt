# The following is an example of settings for vulkan tools.
#  This file allows for per-layer settings which can dynamically affect layer
#  behavior. Comments in this file are denoted with the "#" char.
#  Settings lines are of the form "<LayerName><SettingName> = <SettingValue>"

# Example of actual settings for each layer
#

# VK_LUNARG_LAYER_api_dump Settings - NOTE that VK_LUNARG_LAYER_api_dump is
# not a validation layer and the common settings for ReportFlags and
# DebugAction do not apply
# Detailed TRUE causes parameter details to be dumped in addition to API calls
ApiDumpDetailed = TRUE
# NoAddr TRUE causes "address" to be dumped in place of hex addresses
ApiDumpNoAddr = FALSE
# File = TRUE indicates that output should be written to file instead of STDOUT
ApiDumpFile = FALSE
# LogFilename is file to dump to when "File = TRUE" default is "vk_apidump.txt"
ApiDumpLogFilename = stdout
# Flush = TRUE causes IO to be flushed after each line that's written
